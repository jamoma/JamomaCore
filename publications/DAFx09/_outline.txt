What differentiates TTBlue?


Major Features
	
	Reflection: introspection, dynamic-binding, polymorphic value typing
	Class Registry: searchable class factory based on a metadata/database model
	Efficient block processing: including system of manipulating function pointers for process methods
	Scheduler: for asynchronous events and operations
	C++: Can use an compiler on any platform (unlike ObjC, for instance)
	Cross Platform: Mac, Win, Embedded, Linux?
	Clean interface for extending TTBlue with external classes
	Tools for automated stress testing and regression testing
	Automated wrapper creation for generating plug-ins from TTBlue classes very quickly
	Built for multi-channel with support flexible and dynamically changing channel configurations
	Library of ready-built units for audio analysis, generation, and transformation
	

An example: 
	The DC blocker?  Or the 1-pole lowpass?
