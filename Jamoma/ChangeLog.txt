Version 0.3 (9 April 2006)

* Jamoma now uses OpenSoundControl for communication. All modules have been updated accordingly. 
* Added templates for creating various kinds of modules and algorithms.
* Modules now automatically resize their containers (bpatcher frame or window dimensions) when loaded
* Hub/Gui Changes:
	- Module size can now be queried using the /getmodulesize message, returning e.g. /modulesize 1U-half. 
	- @library_type attribute renamed to @algorithm_type.  This attribute also uses more intelligent defaults based on the module_type that is specified.
	- The @options attribute has been eliminated.  In its place, we are now using more precise @module_type attributes with class-like nomenclature.  For example:
		- audio
		- audio.no_panel
		- audio.ambisonic
		- control
		- video
		- video.gl (not implemented, but reserved for future usage)
	- Added @inspector attribute (1/0) to add inspector window to the module

* Added new folder for 3rd part libraries and externals
	- Added zipped version of 3rd part GNU LGPL externals made by jasch/ICST (http://www.icst.net/downloads/) in new folder /library/externals_3rd_part:
	- ambiencode~: Ambisonic encoding
	- ambidecode~: Ambisonic decoding
	- Added ttblue library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ttblue). Used for compiling jmod.limiter~ and jmod.saturation~.

	- Change log is now a separate rich text format file.
	- Further work on JIG, both to reflect the change to OpenSoundControl, and to provide more details. Removed some restrictions that are no longer required. 
	- Added a new overview patch
	- New example added from the Teatrix workshop @ BEK
	- New example added that re-generates all HTML for the modules using scripting
* Externals: 
	- jmod.oscroute: new external for Routing of OpenSoundControl messages. 
	- jmod.equals: new external for comparing symbols 
	- jmod.sum%: new external sums the pixels in a Jitter matrix and returns the center of gravity for them
	- Several audio externals moved from blue to being Jamoma-native, and renamed accordingly. 
	- On Mac OSX platform all externals are now compiled as Mach-O using Xcode 
	- jmod.pass has implemented several new features for dealing with messages starting with a "/", required when passing and routing OSC messages. 
	- jmod.bridge has been incorporated into jmod.hub and no longer exists.  This have some important implications: jmod.bridge is no longer required in main patches. Instead it is required to provide an unique OSC-compatible name (starting with "/") for each module.

	- jmod.autoscale.mxt - autoscaling of control values 
	- jmod.filewatcher - used for opening files and watching them for changes in external editors

* New control modules (and algorithms):
	- jmod.mappings: create relationships between module parameters, returns, and messages
	- jmod.oscnet: send and receive OpenSoundControl messages over a network 
	- jmod.hi: module for using human interface devices (game controllers, tablets, etc.)

	- Implemented new WAIT command in jmod.cuelist.mod. 
	- jmod.limi~ renamed to jmod.limiter~
* Bug fixes to components
	- jmod.message now uses @clipmode none as the default rather than @clipmode both
	- Fixed bug in jmod.line 
	- Fixed bug in jmod.cuelist.mod. Can still be developed further for elegancy, functions and efficiency. Maybe for 0.4.
