 * @brief Provides a common interface to soundfile data
 *
 * @details This object provides a common set of attributes and methods for working with soundfiles at a specific filepath.
 * This allows us to access metadata and copy values in a common way without duplicating code. As with the rest of the
 * SoundfileLib, the third-party <a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">libsndfile library</a> is used for actual
 * access.
